# Ampersand
*e-Book format, hardware and application*[^1]


**Ampersand** is a new kind of e-Book, intended to be a combination of [hardware](DEFS/HARDWARE/_hardware.md), a [digital format](DEFS/oaf.md) and a [reading application](DEFS/app.md), focused on [readers' inputs](DEFS/notes.md) and their [social applications](DEFS/social.md). Annotations are [optimised](DEFS/ai.md), grouped in [radial diagrams](DEFS/mesh.md), and located in an [information landscape](DEFS/landscape.md).


[^1]: Ampersand comes from the Latin word *et* (and). The idea is to reinforce the collaborative aspect of the format, as in "Reader & book".
