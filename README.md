# Ampersand
## Ampersand eBook project

This is the GitHub initiative for the Ampersand project.

My name is Luli Radfahrer. I've been a tenured associate professor at [ECA](https://www.eca.usp.br/)/[USP](https://www5.usp.br/), Brazil, for the last 30 years, in which I researched, mentored and taught. That led me to write some books (like [this](http://www.estantevirtual.com.br/livros/luli-radfahrer/design-web-design/3544325215) on design and [this](http://www.estantevirtual.com.br/livros/luli-radfahrer/enciclopedia-da-nuvem/927040668?gclid=CjwKCAjw7--KBhAMEiwAxfpkWK8_ma4BMbfwB04tMV5WU6_Ul8PmMVroCWUTpQ5BAZetJdT0qD33aRoC0RUQAvD_BwE) on cloud technologies, both already out of print). It also led me to writing a [column](http://www.bit.ly/luli-folha) for the biggest brazilian newspaper, **Folha de S. Paulo**, to some [media interviews](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQTUQG-vBiU), [public lectures](http://www.ted.com/talks/luli_radfahrer_os_empregos_acabaram_e_isso_e_uma_excelente_noticia?language=pt-br) and talks, always about the impact of digital technologies on society. But all too ephemeral, and with little impact.

In October 2021, after the global pandemic, I began a 10-year journey to reinvent what we know as the e-book, that I intend to post here. It will be registered in English, for this is supposed to be an open source, worldwide project.

All help is welcome. Thanks in advance.

Best regards, L.
