# Ampersand
*Work in progress. Started in Oct'21*


The **Ampersand[^1] Project** is developing a new kind of e-Book ([format](DEFS/oaf.md) and [application](DEFS/app.md)), focused on the [social importance](DEFS/social.md) of [readers' annotations](DEFS/marginalia.md), which are [optimised](DEFS/ai.md) and grouped in [radial diagrams](DEFS/meshes.md).



[^1]: "The ampersand is a symbol evolved from the Latin *et*, meaning *and*. One of the oldest alphabetic abbreviations, it has assumed over the centuries a wonderful variety of forms. (...) The word came from an alteration of the phrase *“et, per se and”* (*“et by itself \[means\] and”*), which became *“and, per-se and”*, and then *ampersand*." - Robert Bringhurst, *The Elements of Typographic Style*  p. 78, 301 - https://bit.ly/2YqBWyl. The name is used to reinforce the collaborative aspect of the format, as in *Reader & book*.
