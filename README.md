# Ampersand
*Work in progress. Started in Oct'21*


The **Ampersand[^1] Project** is a new kind of e-Book, a combination of [hardware](DEFS/HARDWARE/_hardware.md), [digital format](DEFS/oaf.md) and a [reading application](DEFS/app.md), focused on [readers' inputs](DEFS/notes.md) and their [social applications](DEFS/social.md). Annotations are [optimised](DEFS/ai.md), grouped in [radial diagrams](DEFS/mesh.md), and located in an [information landscape](DEFS/landscape.md).




[^1]: Ampersand comes from the Latin word *et* (and). The idea is to reinforce the collaborative aspect of the format, as in "Reader & book".
