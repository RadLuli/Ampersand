# Ampersand
*Work in progress. Started in Oct'21*


The **Ampersand[^1] Project** is a new kind of e-Book, a combination of
[hardware](DEFS/HARDWARE/_hardware.md), [digital format](DEFS/oaf.md) and a [reading application](DEFS/app.md), focused on [readers' inputs](DEFS/notes.md) and their [social applications](DEFS/social.md). Annotations are
[optimised](DEFS/ai.md), grouped in [radial diagrams](DEFS/mesh.md), and located in an [information landscape](DEFS/landscape.md).




[^1]: Ampersand is a is a ligature of the letters "E" and "T". It comes from the Latin word *et* (and). As the Roman Empire expanded, many languages absorbed this ligature into their alphabets.
The word came from an alteration of the phrase *“et, per se and”* (*“et by itself [means] and”*), which became *“and, per-se and”*, and then *ampersand*. - see https://bit.ly/3DgFMsV.

The idea is to reinforce the collaborative aspect of the format, as in *Reader & book*.
