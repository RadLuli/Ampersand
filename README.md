# Ampersand
*Work in progress. Started in Oct'21*


The **Ampersand[^1] Project** is a new kind of e-Book, a combination of
[hardware](DEFS/HARDWARE/_hardware.md), [digital format](DEFS/oaf.md) and a [reading application](DEFS/app.md), focused on [readers' inputs](DEFS/notes.md) and their [social applications](DEFS/social.md). Annotations are
[optimised](DEFS/ai.md), grouped in [radial diagrams](DEFS/mesh.md), and located in an [information landscape](DEFS/landscape.md).




[^1]: "The ampersand is a symbol evolved from the Latin *et*, meaning *and*. One of the oldest alphabetic abbreviations, it has assumed over the centuries a wonderful variety of forms. (...) The word came from an alteration of the phrase *“et, per se and”* (*“et by itself [means] and”*), which became *“and, per-se and”*, and then *ampersand*." - Robert Bringhurst, *The Elements of Typographic Style*  p. 78, 301 - https://bit.ly/2YqBWyl.

The name is used to reinforce the collaborative aspect of the format, as in *Reader & book*.
