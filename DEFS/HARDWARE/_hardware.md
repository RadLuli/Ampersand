# Ampersand Hardware
*To develop later*


The **Ampersand hardware** is a *hardware concept/prototype*, in which the Ampersand application would run in optimal conditions. Some ideas for it are:

- **Size** - three possible sizes - 
	- *Pocket* - something like a Moleskine Reporter pocket book, with a protective cover and place to store the stylus; 
	- *Book* - hardcover book size, with enhancements; and
	-  *Magazine* - A4/Letter size, waterproof.
- **Stylus** - should be optimized for haptic experience. Its surface can be plastic, metallic or rubberized, but always with with the weight and diameter of a quality pen. Its tip should face a little resistance while contacting the screen, in order to feel like writing on coarse paper (like *Canson*), not on glass.
- **Screen** - couls have a matte film, that would both prevent scratches and help with the paper sensation.
- **Network** - the device should work as a mesh network antenna, to help community / IoT / Smart City connections.
- **Distributed Processing** - functional languages, like *Elixir* could beused to spread processing across all connected devices, even ones which are not active.
- **Camera and Audio Recorder**

**Base inspiration:**

- e-ink, Kindle
- Mesh network, OLPC
- Non-glaring screen, Kindle
- Touch-resistant screen, skins
- Flash Storage
- Cover, Kindle
- Camera
- Audio recorder
- TBD: Stylus?, iPad Pro

**Welcome add-ons:**

- OCR
- Voice recognition
- Machine vision

- **One Laptop per Child (OLPC)** [^1]
was a non-profit initiative with the goal of transforming children education by creating and distributing educational devices and content. This became the OLPC XO Laptop, a low-cost and low-power laptop computer. The project was originally funded by member organizations such as AMD, eBay, Google, Red Hat etc.

- **Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)**  [^2]
is a chip customized for a particular use, for example, a chip designed to run in a digital voice recorder or a high-efficiency bitcoin miner is an ASIC. Application-specific standard product (ASSP) chips are intermediate between ASICs and industry standard integrated circuits.

- A **Mesh network** [^3] is a local network topology in which the infrastructure nodes connect directly, dynamically and non-hierarchically to as many other nodes as possible and cooperate with one another to efficiently route data from/to clients. Mesh networks dynamically self-organise and self-configure, which can reduce installation overhead. The ability to self-configure enables dynamic distribution of workloads, particularly in the event a few nodes should fail. This in turn contributes to fault-tolerance and reduced maintenance costs.

- A **Wireless mesh network** [^4] is a communications network made up of radio nodes organised in a mesh topology, which can also be a form of wireless ad hoc network. A mesh refers to rich interconnection among devices or nodes. Wireless mesh networks often consist of mesh clients, mesh routers and gateways.  In a wireless mesh network, topology tends to be more static, so that routes computation can converge and delivery of data to their destinations can occur. If nodes constantly or frequently move, the mesh spends more time updating routes than delivering data. It's a low-mobility centralised form of wireless ad hoc network.

- **IEEE 802.11s** [^5] is a wireless LAN standard and an IEEE 802.11 amendment for mesh networking, defining how wireless devices can interconnect to create a wireless LAN (WLAN) mesh network, which may be used for relatively fixed (not mobile) topologies and wireless ad hoc networks. A wireless mesh network, sometimes called WMN, is a typical wireless network but using a mesh topology instead. These networks are often seen as special ad-hoc networks since there's no central node that will break connectivity.

- An **Anonymous P2P** [^6] communication system is a peer-to-peer distributed application in which the nodes, which are used to share resources, or participants are anonymous or pseudonymous. Anonymity is usually achieved by special routing overlay networks that hide the physical location of each node from other participants.

- A **wireless ad hoc network** [^7] or *mobile ad hoc network* is a decentralized type of wireless network. It is "ad hoc" because it does not rely on a pre-existing infrastructure, such as routers or access points. Each node participates in routing by forwarding data for other nodes, so the determination of which nodes forward data is made dynamically on the basis of network connectivity and the routing algorithm in use.   In the Windows operating system, ad hoc is a communication mode (setting) that allows computers to directly communicate with each other without a router. Wireless mobile ad hoc networks are self-configuring, dynamic networks in which nodes are free to move.

- **B. A. T. M. A. N.** [^8], *better approach to mobile ad-hoc networking*, is a routing protocol for multi-hop ad-hoc mesh networks under development by the German "Freifunk" community. It is focused on the decentralization of knowledge about the best route through the network â€” no single node has all the data. This technique eliminates the need to spread information about network changes to every node in the network. Data gets passed from node to node, and packets get individual, dynamically created routes.
