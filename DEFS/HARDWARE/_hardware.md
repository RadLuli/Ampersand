## One Laptop per Child (OLPC)
was a non-profit initiative with the goal of transforming children education by creating and distributing educational devices and content. This became the OLPC XO Laptop, a low-cost and low-power laptop computer. The project was originally funded by member organizations such as AMD, eBay, Google, Red Hat etc. Specs in http://laptop.org/en/laptop/hardware/specs.shtml

## Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
is a chip customized for a particular use, for example, a chip designed to run in a digital voice recorder or a high-efficiency bitcoin miner is an ASIC. Application-specific standard product (ASSP) chips are intermediate between ASICs and industry standard integrated circuits.

## Mesh network
A mesh network is a local network topology in which the infrastructure nodes connect directly, dynamically and non-hierarchically to as many other nodes as possible and cooperate with one another to efficiently route data from/to clients. Mesh networks dynamically self-organise and self-configure, which can reduce installation overhead. The ability to self-configure enables dynamic distribution of workloads, particularly in the event a few nodes should fail. This in turn contributes to fault-tolerance and reduced maintenance costs.

## IEEE 802.11s
is a wireless LAN standard and an IEEE 802.11 amendment for mesh networking, defining how wireless devices can interconnect to create a wireless LAN (WLAN) mesh network, which may be used for relatively fixed (not mobile) topologies and wireless ad hoc networks. A wireless mesh network, sometimes called WMN, is a typical wireless network but using a mesh topology instead. These networks are often seen as special ad-hoc networks since there's no central node that will break connectivity.

## Wireless mesh network
A wireless mesh network (WMN) is a communications network made up of radio nodes organised in a mesh topology, which can also be a form of wireless ad hoc network. A mesh refers to rich interconnection among devices or nodes. Wireless mesh networks often consist of mesh clients, mesh routers and gateways.  In a wireless mesh network, topology tends to be more static, so that routes computation can converge and delivery of data to their destinations can occur. If nodes constantly or frequently move, the mesh spends more time updating routes than delivering data. It is a low-mobility centralised form of wireless ad hoc network.

## Anonymous P2P
An anonymous P2P communication system is a peer-to-peer distributed application in which the nodes, which are used to share resources, or participants are anonymous or pseudonymous. Anonymity is usually achieved by special routing overlay networks that hide the physical location of each node from other participants.
