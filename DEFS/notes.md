# Notes
Reader annotations

## Scrapbooks 
Are collections of unrelated user notes, in any form available. When they are organised in a tree structure, they become meshes.   

## Public notes and meshes 
Can be shared, ranked, combined with other notes and commented, just like books. They are dynamic, though, not to be considered finished, unless marked as such.   

## Unpublished user-created meshes 
are considered **scrapbooks**, and can be made from scratch; from system-generated meshes; or from public meshes. They can be kept private indefinitely or optimized and shared in three ways: as full meshes; as parts of larger meshes; or as locations in the information landscape.
