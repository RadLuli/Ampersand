# Reader annotations
*Usage*

## Scrapbooks
Are collections of unrelated user notes, in any form available. When they are organised in a tree structure, they become meshes.

## Public notes and meshes
Can be shared, ranked, combined with other notes and commented, just like books. They are dynamic, though, not to be considered finished, unless marked as such.

## Unpublished user-created meshes
are considered **scrapbooks**, and can be made from scratch; from system-generated meshes; or from public meshes. They can be kept private indefinitely or optimized and shared in three ways: as full meshes; as parts of larger meshes; or as locations in the information landscape.

Notes can only become public when their author is logged to the system, even if offline. Only logged users can submit content, comment or act on the network.   Unpublished user-created meshes are considered scrapbooks, and can be made from scratch; from system-generated meshes; or from public meshes.

**Marginalia** — reader annotations in book margins[^1] are (for me, at least) the pinnacle point of a book relationship with its audience, intense up to the point where  readers cannot contain themselves and **need** to mark right there, in the book body, their opinion and/or additional comments. It is a very rich moment that needs to be shared, for even the note-takers tend to be surprised by their impact when rereading their notes. Sadly, these notes are usually wasted.

*From Wikipedia* — "Catherine C. Marshall, doing research on the future of [user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface "User interface") design, has studied the phenomenon of user annotation of texts. She discovered that in several university departments, students would scour the piles of textbooks at used book dealers for consistently annotated copies. The students had a good appreciation for their predecessors' distillation of knowledge. In recent years, the marginalia left behind by university students as they engage with library textbooks has also been a topic of interest to sociologists looking to understand the experience of being a university student. See [*Marginalia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia), notes [8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia#cite_note-8), [9](https://en.swikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia#cite_note-9), [10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia#cite_note-10), [11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia#cite_note-11) and [12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia#cite_note-12)".


**Contributions** here the name *Ampersand* shows its meaning. In the [OAF](oaf.md) format, the book author acts as a *spark*, a *conversation starter*, who doesn't even need to be central. A reader's work can be even bigger or more comprehensive than the original book its [mesh](mesh.md) is based upon, just like what happens in modern genres like *fanfic* or in collaborative books/blogs like “The Martian”, in which the commenting community has a strong influence over the work. Unlike this kind of blog that become books (and films, like *Julie&Julia*) authors don't keep all the glory for themselves. Readers/collaborators can cooperate with any amount of public meshes, texts and/or media.

**Annotations** can be made on:
- Typed text
- Dictated text
- Manuscript
- Audio recordings
- Photos
- Video recordings
- Drawings
- Links

Notes should be in **<span style="color:#18ffff">color</span>** to speed up content identification and recall.

All **public annotations**, whether created automatically or made by users, as well as their edit log, are recorded in a blockchain. Annotation authors can access or modify previous public editions, but even if they are deleted from the public mesh, the platform can access its log in the blockchain to prevent misconduct.

Private annotations (scrapbooks) are, by definition, completely free and editable and can be completely deleted. A private annotation can only be made public by its author from his device(s). Screenshots can be immediately deleted without any prior notice.

The system does not care about the origin or piracy of books. There is no store.
