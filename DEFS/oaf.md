# Open Annotation Format (OAF)
*Format*

All readable e-book formats are eligible. Image-only PDFs, .djvu, or DRM-protected formats like .azw may not be read or converted into meshes. In markup-formatted text with no TOC, headings H1-H6 can be converted to a mesh.

When an e-book or electronic text document is imported into the format, its index/TOC is copied to a mesh, and its ISBN (if available) is queried to manage its position in the information landscape, and whether there are already any direct or indirect references to it or its authors.
