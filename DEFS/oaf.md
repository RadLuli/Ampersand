# Open Annotation Format (OAF)
Format

All readable e-book formats are eligible. Image-only PDFs, .djvu, or DRM-protected formats like .azw will not be converted into meshes. In markup-formatted text with no TOC, headings H1-H6 will be converted to a mesh.

When an e-book or electronic text document is imported into the Open Annotation Format, its index/TOC is  copied to a mesh, and its ISBN (if available) is queried to manage its position in the information landscape, and whether there are already any direct or indirect references to it or its authors.   The idea is not to have a book store, nor a proprietary format. Piracy is not a platform concern, it does not scan private user content, only public user meshes, which are also hosted and registered in a blockchain.
