# Meshes and scrapbooks
*Automatic and user-generated reader annotations*

A **Mesh** is a circular tree diagram, drawn in hyperbolic space[^1], and used to visually organize the information in an hierarchical form, showing the relationships among branches of a selected subject. Meshes are often created around a single concept in the center, to which associated representations of ideas are added. Major ideas connect directly to the central concept, and other concepts branch out from them.

Meshes look like *mind maps[^2]*, but with more features, multidimensional, and integrated and with an artificial intelligence system to interpret similar content and rank popular connections between similar associations.

Among the many strengths of this format are:
- **Multi-dimensionality** — branches and topics can be of any size, and vary immensely;
- **Non-linearity** — topics can start from any point;
- **Thematic diversity** — any topic can build upon any other. Its relevance is up to the author of the mesh;
- **Formal diversity** — colors, shapes, sounds, photos, videos, links, texts and dictations are some possible formats to use.


## Automatic meshes

When an electronic text document is imported into the Format, its index/TOC is copied to a mesh, and its ISBN (if available) is queried to manage its position in the [information landscape](landscape.md), and whether there are already any references to it or its authors.

Scanned formats (.djvu, photocopy PDFs etc) can be digitized but will not generate automatic meshes. These formats are, gladly, increasingly uncommon.


## Annotations

User **annotations**, when written or drawn, should be made in **<span style="color:#18ffff">color</span>** to speed up content identification and recall. They can be made on:
- Typed text
- Dictated text
- Manuscript
- Audio recordings
- Photos
- Video recordings
- Drawings
- Links


## Scrapbooks and private meshes

**Scrapbooks** are collections of unrelated user notes, in any form available. When organised in a tree structure, they become private meshes.

Private user meshes can be made from scratch, from system-generated meshes or from public meshes. They can be kept private indefinitely or optimized and shared in three ways:
- as full meshes;
- as parts of larger meshes; or
- as locations in the information landscape.

Notes can only become public when their author is logged to the system, even if offline. Only logged users can submit content, comment or act on the network.


## Public Meshes

The open nature of annotations naturally allows books and meshes to be referenced in other books and meshes. All public user contributions, even if minimal, can be aggregated to — or accessed from — other meshes, which can be shared, ranked, combined with other notes and commented like books.

All public meshes are recorded in a blockchain. Their authors can access or modify previous public editions, but even if they are deleted from the public mesh, the platform can access its log in the blockchain to prevent misconduct.


## Private annotations

Private annotations (and scrapbooks) are, by definition, completely free and editable and can be completely deleted. A private annotation can only be made public by its author from his device(s). Screenshots can be immediately deleted without any prior notice.

The idea is not to have a book store, nor a proprietary format. Piracy is not a platform concern, it does not scan private user content,it only scans public user meshes, which are also hosted and registered in a blockchain.

### To do:
- Understand mind maps, if they are a trademark of Buzan.
- Understand mind maps, their effect as forms of learning and communication.
- Is it worth to keep each public map independent or to assume right away that all the recorded interpretations of a book will be parts of the same public mesh, or whether this may result in information overload.
- How to combine all this information avoiding excess, redundancy or recursion? The same goes for both direct references to books and meshes, as well as indirect references. One idea might be to use a point structure such as “pagerank” to assign relevance in the information landscape. Something similar to the academic impact factor.

[^1]: A hyperbolic tree is an information visualization and graph drawing method inspired by hyperbolic geometry. Nodes in focus are placed in the center and given more room, while out-of-focus nodes are compressed near  boundaries. Focusing on a different node brings it and its children to the center of the disk, while uninteresting portions of the tree are compressed. Hyperbolic trees employ hyperbolic space, which intrinsically has "more room" than Euclidean space. The Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry displays the entire hyperbolic plane within a unit disk, making the entire tree visible at once. The unit disk gives a fish-eye lens view of the plane, giving more emphasis to nodes which are in focus and displaying nodes further out of focus closer to the boundary of the disk. Hyperbolic trees were patented in the U.S. by Xerox in 1996, since expired. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_tree

[^2]: the term "Mind Map" was popularized by Tony Buzan, and can even be a trademark. Anyway, it's just a part of what a Mesh can become.
