# Mesh
*Annotation Format*

Radial diagrams are used to visually organize information hierarchically, showing the relationships among pieces of the whole. They are often created around a single concept in the center, to which associated representations of ideas are added. Major ideas are connected directly to the central concept, and other concepts branch out from them.

A mesh is a circular tree diagram, displayed in hyperbolic space. User meshes are graphs represented, compared and combined in these structures. System-generated meshes are created automatically by the system, usually based on a document TOC.

A hyperbolic tree is an information visualization and graph drawing method inspired by hyperbolic geometry. Nodes in focus are placed in the center and given more room, while out-of-focus nodes are compressed near  boundaries. Focusing on a different node brings it and its children to the center of the disk, while uninteresting portions of the tree are compressed. Hyperbolic trees employ hyperbolic space, which intrinsically has "more room" than Euclidean space. The Poincar√© disk model of hyperbolic geometry displays the entire hyperbolic plane within a unit disk, making the entire tree visible at once. The unit disk gives a fish-eye lens view of the plane, giving more emphasis to nodes which are in focus and displaying nodes further out of focus closer to the boundary of the disk. Hyperbolic trees were patented in the U.S. by Xerox in 1996, since expired.
