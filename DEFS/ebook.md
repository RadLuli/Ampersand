# EBook
*Document format*

**Books** — text documents in computer-readable formats. Scanned formats (.djvu, photocopy PDFs etc) can be digitized but will not generate automatic meshes. These formats are, gladly, increasingly uncommon.

**Import** — retrieve the index/TOC of the text and transform it into a mesh[^1]. With the support of Artificial Intelligence algorithms, both essential and redundant parts of the TOC are *optimized*, identifying both essential and redundant parts of the converted index, with suggestions on its form and location, before integrating it to the information landscape.

[^1]: **TODO:** — see Obsidian Knowledge management, also study the EPUB3 format to understand how the index/TOC is marked. Also check the structure of library cards, the Dewey index and the formation of the ISBN, as well as the Library of \[US\] Congress. Wikipedia's set of categories is also an option. Is it possible, through the ISBN or catalog card, to discover the macro area in which a given book is located to locate it in an information landscape?
