# Information Landscape
*definition*

I believe that the understanding (and even the exposure to) any content is never linear, nor it happens at the same depth level for different readers â€” a physicist and a philosopher can read a math book in quite different ways. Instead of exposing a universe of knowledge in the same way to everyone, the idea is to distribute the knowledge in a three-dimensional "landscape", which can be visited in different ways, each with a different level of exposure, depth and interaction possible or demanded.

An **information landscape** is a graphic metaphor to visualize abstract data groups in different depth levels. Its visitors can use different "vehicles" and follow different routes to get to the information needed - e. g. a "guided tour bus" gives an overview of the journey, with a broad scope, but little freedom, while "walking aimlessly" leads to the opposite. The idea here is to provide a single information structure, to be experienced in different ways. Some possible interaction ways are:

| Vehicle | Information level | Location | Freedom | Interactivity |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Tour bus** | Shallow | Guided | None | Very little |
| **Public transport (surface)** | Shallow | Fixed | None | little |
| **Subway** | Focused | Fixed | None | Little |
| **Car/Taxi** | Average | Free | Little | Little |
| **Bicycle** | Deep | Free | Medium | Medium |
| **Walking** | Deep | Free | Hight | High |
| **Visit to address** | Very deep | Free | Extreme | Very high |

This way, someone who does not know a subject (e.g. Jazz) can take a guided tour bus with predetermined stopping points on the way, to get a good overview of the subject. An enthusiast or specialist (a musician, in the previous example) would not waste time with imprecisions and could go straight to the necessary address, extracting information incomprehensible (or not valid) to a layperson.

**Locations** in the information landscape are content blocks represented as addresses in a graphic representation of knowledge. Classification systems, like the *Library of \[US\] Congress Classification*[^1], the *Dewey Decimal Classification*[^2], *Wikipedia Categories*[^3] and number addressing systems like *ISBN*[^4] can be used.

### To do:
- use tags, questionnaires, taxonomies, folksonomies to help determine (or refine) a location or address in an informational landscape?
- See categories (and even the Amazon API[^6]), why not?
- ISBN = ZIP code?

[^1]: The *Library of \[US\] Congress Classification* is a system of library classification used for shelving books in a library. It has been criticized for lacking a sound theoretical basis; many of the classification decisions were driven by the practical needs of that library rather than epistemological considerations. Although it divides subjects into broad categories, it is essentially enumerative in nature. That is, it provides a guide to the books actually in one library's collections, not a classification of the world. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Classification


[^2]: The *Dewey Decimal Classification*, or Dewey Decimal System, is a proprietary library classification system. OCLC, a non-profit cooperative that serves libraries, currently maintains the system and licenses online access to WebDewey, a continuously updated version for catalogers. It introduced the concepts of relative location and index, which allow new books to be added to a library in their appropriate location based on subject.  The classification's notation makes use of three-digit numbers for main classes, with fractional decimals allowing expansion for further detail. Numbers can be expanded to cover special aspects of general subjects. A library assigns a classification number that unambiguously locates a particular volume in a position relative to other books in the library, on the basis of its subject. It is used in 200,000 libraries in at least 135 countries. Wikipedia has a comparison of Dewey and Library of Congress subject classification systems: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Dewey_and_Library_of_Congress_subject_classification


[^3]: Main *Wikipedia Categories* are General reference / Culture and the arts / Geography and places / Health and fitness / History and events / Human activities / Mathematics and logic / Natural and physical sciences / People and self / Philosophy and thinking / Religion and belief systems / Society and social sciences / Technology and applied sciences. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AContents%2FCategories


[^4]: The International Standard Book Number (*ISBN*) is an unique numeric commercial book identifier, purchased from the International ISBN Agency and its affiliates. The number is 10 digits long if assigned before 2007, and 13 digits long after that. The assigning method is nation-specific and varies between countries, often depending on how large the publishing industry is. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number. And an article on using ISBN as Uniform Resource Names: http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3187

[^5]: The first (and only) time I saw the term used was an article by Fabrice Florin in a book on interactive multimedia learning published by Apple in 1990. There's no trace of this concept online and it seems that even its author forgot about it.
