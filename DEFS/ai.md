# Artificial Intelligence
*Usage*

AI content management: all non-public user content is regarded as private, to be ignored by all platform management. Cloud backups, when available, are to be encoded through cryptography. All public data, graphs and user blockchain databases processing is to be distributed among all connected hardware and apps.

AI content optimization: the system is able to discern content elements, in order to group them into similar themes and attribute value to usual associations (following the idea that neurons that fire together, wire together) in a way that they become evident in public and suggested meshes, as well as in the information landscape, no matter how they were recorded.

Distributed processing: functional programming languages like Elixir can be used for back-end,  known for running low-latency, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems.
