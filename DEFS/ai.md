# Artificial Intelligence content optimization
*Usage*

The system should be able to discern content elements, group them into similar themes and attribute value to usual associations (following the idea that *neurons that fire together, wire together*) in a way that they become evident in [public meshes](meshes.md), no matter how they were recorded.

## Distributed processing:

Functional programming languages like Elixir[^1] can be used for back-end,  known for running low-latency, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems.
