# Authors and readers
*Roles in an Ampersand social network*


**Authors** are usually the ones most affected in interactive content environments, since their work can never be considered *finished*. This leads most authors who stick to the format either to keep the content constantly updated (and to promptly answer readers' requests and doubts, something that usually happens in blog posts open to online comments), or to be replaced by editorial/content teams. 

None of the options benefit the reading experience, for they may discourage interaction, or, when it happens, multiple anonymous authors make a content lose its authenticity.

In the OAF format, an author does what has always been done, finishing a book with no interruptions. Once imported, the book itself is immutable, user contributions are registered in its mesh and requests can are dealt with the community - of which an author can decide how to take part.



**Users** can, of course, be passive readers, just like what happens in all other e-reading platforms, but this is not what is expected in a true *Ampersand* experience. Reader users are, of course, not expected to be *co-authors*, for this is too big a demand for any reader.

The idea is for users to be **collaborators**, who, as the term says are, *co-laborers*, meaning people who, like the author, are also dedicated to the topic, albeit without as much authority, depth, competence or even dedication.

This is why their name stays at the right side of the Ampersand, like in "*The Origin of Species & Luli*"


  It will be up to the members of the social network built around the book, if they deem it to be appropriate, to update or expand any context or data. Authors can, at any time, engage in the building of public meshes (provided that they are properly identified, like all other users), and their pieces may have a greater weight or a more central location in the mesh. Like in LinkedIn comments, where the post's author is always marked as such.
