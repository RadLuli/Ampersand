# Authors and reader-collaborators
*Roles in an Ampersand social network*


**Authors** are usually the ones most affected in interactive content environments, since their work can never be considered *finished*. This leads most authors who stick to an interactive format either to keep the content constantly updated (and to promptly answer readers' requests and doubts, something that happens in blog posts open to online comments), or to be replaced by editorial/content teams.

None of the options benefit the reading experience, for they may discourage interaction, or, when it happens, multiple anonymous authors make a content lose its authenticity.

In the OAF format, an author does what has always been done, finishing a book with no interruptions. Once imported, the book itself is immutable, user contributions are registered in its mesh and requests can are dealt with the community - of which an author can decide how to take part.

It will be up to the members of the social network built around the book, if they deem appropriate, to update or expand any context or data. Authors can, at any time, engage in the building of public meshes (properly identified, like all other users), and their pieces may have a greater weight or a more central location in the mesh. Like in LinkedIn comments, where the post's author is always marked as such.

**Users** can, of course, be passive readers, like what happens in other e-reading platforms, but this is not what is expected in a true *Ampersand* experience. Reader users are, of course, not expected to be *co-authors*, for this is too big a demand for any reader.

The idea is for users to be **collaborators**, who, as the term says are, *co-laborers* (coworkers) whose work comes along with the original, to be read as a comment, like a preface or a workbook. They are commited to the topic, like the author, although without as much authority, depth, competence or even dedication. This is why their name stays at the right side of the Ampersand, like in "*The Origin of Species & Luli*".

User inputs can be of any form available (recordings, dictations, selected excerpts, drawings, handwritten text, photos, videos and links)
Social applications: ï»¿most digital readers allow for sharing and commenting book excerpts through social media, but in a non-structured way, that may focus on one or more passages, even on the book as a whole. By sharing whole book annotations, Ampersands can turn books into focused social media, comparing  approaches and readings out of the same subject.
