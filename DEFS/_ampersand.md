# Ampersand[^1]
is an e-Book (planned to be a combination of [hardware](HARDWARE/_hardware.md), and a [digital format](oaf.md) and [reading application](app.md)), focused on [readers' inputs](notes.md) and their [social applications](social.md). Annotations are [optimised](ai.md), grouped in [radial diagrams](mesh.md), and located in an [information landscape](landscape.md).

### Footnote

[^1]: Ampersand comes from et. The idea is to reinforce the collaborative aspect of the format, as in "Reader & book". https://medium.com/black-lion-banner/the-history-of-the-ampersand-c81839171940
