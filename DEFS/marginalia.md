# Marginalia
*Reader annotations*

Reader [annotations](users.md) in book margins[^1] are (for me, at least) the pinnacle of a book relationship with its audience, intense up to the point where  readers cannot contain themselves and **need** to mark right there, in the book body, their opinion and/or additional comments. It is a very rich moment that needs to be shared, for even the note-takers tend to be surprised by their impact when rereading their notes. Sadly, these notes are usually wasted. The idea here is to make them social, in *[mesh](meshes.md)* formats.

### To do:

*From Wikipedia* â€” "Catherine C. Marshall, doing research on the future of [user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface "User interface") design, has studied the phenomenon of user annotation of texts. She discovered that in several university departments, students would scour the piles of textbooks at used book dealers for consistently annotated copies. The students had a good appreciation for their predecessors' distillation of knowledge. In recent years, the marginalia left behind by university students as they engage with library textbooks has also been a topic of interest to sociologists looking to understand the experience of being a university student. See [*Marginalia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia), notes [8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia#cite_note-8), [9](https://en.swikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia#cite_note-9), [10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia#cite_note-10), [11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia#cite_note-11) and [12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia#cite_note-12)".
