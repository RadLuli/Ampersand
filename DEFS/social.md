# Social Applications
*Usage*

Readers which develop public meshes become ﻿collaborators, coworkers whose work comes along with the original, to be read as a comment, like a preface or a workbook.

Reader's inputs (which, in printed books, are recorded in marginalia) can be of any form available (recordings, dictations, selected excerpts, drawings, handwritten text, photos, videos and links)
Social applications: ﻿most digital readers allow for sharing and commenting book excerpts through social media, but usually in a non-structured way, that may focus on one or more passages, but rarely on the book as a whole. By sharing whole book annotations, Ampersands can turn books into focused social media, comparing  approaches and readings out of the same subject.

The system is designed to work seamlessly, no matter its connection status. In offline mode, all social features will be disabled, and some activities, like mesh upload or update can be stored for later usage.

User blockchain database: all public content is registered in a blockchain database, and can be traced to its owner. Bots are not allowed and should be blocked without previous notice. Unsuitable content can result in hardware lock.

**Social Applications** — Books can be the starting point of very specific **social networks** that work like Internet forums: only someone who has something really relevant to add tends to be given any space.

Nowadays, that less than a dozen very generic "social networks" centralize most of the social activity, an attitude of "fame for its own sake", typical of celebrity culture, which does not tend to generate anything constructive, is commonplace.

If, instead of a few large social networks, there are millions of very specific communities, each for every book theme, generic identities tend to lose value. It doesn't make sense that someone who has nothing to contribute to the universe of a theme like “Harry Potter”, for example, has to seek space in a network whose center is in one of these books. (see *locus/place of speech*)

**Public notes** — In Ampersand social networks, the "social" behavior [^1] is taken very seriously. This does not mean that meshes have to be formal, nor to have factual accuracy — they are *opinions*, after all, not academic works — but good behavior is by no means optional. Anything that has been recorded in public annotations will be marked in a blockchain and will have its author identified. Depending on the type of behavior, authors can be notified, given either a “right to be forgotten”, a temporary or even a permanent ban from the network, including hardware lock.
