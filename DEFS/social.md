# Social Applications
Usage

Reader's inputs (which, in printed books, are recorded in marginalia) can be of any form available (recordings, dictations, selected excerpts, drawings, handwritten text, photos, videos and links)
Social applications: ï»¿most digital readers allow for sharing and commenting book excerpts through social media, but usually in a non-structured way, that may focus on one or more passages, but rarely on the book as a whole. By sharing whole book annotations, Ampersands can turn books into focused social media, comparing  approaches and readings out of the same subject.

The system is designed to work seamlessly, no matter its connection status. In offline mode, all social features will be disabled, and some activities, like mesh upload or update can be stored for later usage.
