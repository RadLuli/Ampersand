# Social Applications
*Usage*

Books are the starting point of specific **social networks**, which work like Internet forums: space is given only to someone who has something relevant to add.

Nowadays, that less than a dozen generic "social networks" centralize most of the social activity, an attitude of "fame for its own sake", typical of celebrity culture, which does not tend to generate anything constructive, is commonplace.

If, instead of few large social networks, there are millions of specific communities, each for every book theme, generic identities tend to lose value. It doesn't make sense that someone who has nothing to contribute to the universe of a theme like “Harry Potter”, for example, would have a relevant space in a network whose center is in one of these books[^1].

The "social" behavior[^2] is here taken seriously. Meshes do not need to be formal, nor to present any factual accuracy — they are *opinions*, after all, not academic works — but good behavior is by no means optional. All public annotations are logged in a blockchain, with their author identified. Depending on the behavior, authors can be notified, given either a “right to be forgotten”, a temporary suspension, or even a permanent ban from the network, including hardware lock. Bots are not allowed and should be blocked without previous notice.

The idea is not to have a book store, nor a proprietary format. Piracy is not a platform concern, it does not scan private user content,it only scans public user meshes, which are also hosted and registered in a blockchain.
