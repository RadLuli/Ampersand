Notes can only become public when their author is logged to the system, even if offline. Only logged users can submit content, comment or act on the network.   Unpublished user-created meshes are considered scrapbooks, and can be made from scratch; from system-generated meshes; or from public meshes.
Welcome add-ons: OCR Voice- recognition Machine vision
Reader's inputs (which, in printed books, are recorded in marginalia) can be of any form available (recordings, dictations, selected excerpts, drawings, handwritten text, photos, videos and links)
Social applications: ﻿most digital readers allow for sharing and commenting book excerpts through social media, but usually in a non-structured way, that may focus on one or more passages, but rarely on the book as a whole. By sharing whole book annotations, Ampersands can turn books into focused social media, comparing  approaches and readings out of the same subject.

Distributed processing: functional programming languages like Elixir can be used for back-end,  known for running low-latency, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems.
Radial diagrams are used to visually organize information hierarchically, showing the relationships among pieces of the whole. They are often created around a single concept in the center, to which associated representations of ideas are added. Major ideas are connected directly to the central concept, and other concepts branch out from them.
The system is designed to work seamlessly, no matter its connection status. In offline mode, all social features will be disabled, and some activities, like mesh upload or update can be stored for later usage.
AI content management: all non-public user content is regarded as private, to be ignored by all platform management. Cloud backups, when available, are to be encoded through cryptography. All public data, graphs and user blockchain databases processing is to be distributed among all connected hardware and apps.
An information landscape is a graphic metaphor to visualize abstract data groups in different depth levels. Its visitors can use different "vehicles" and follow different routes to get to the information needed - e. g. a "guided tour bus" gives an overview of the journey, with a broad scope, but little freedom, while "walking aimlessly" usually leads to the opposite. The idea is to provide only one information structure, to be experienced in many different ways.
Locations in the info landscape are the addresses in the graphic representation of the content. Number systems like ISBN can be used.
Readers which develop public meshes become ﻿collaborators, coworkers whose work comes along with the original, to be read as a comment, like a preface or a workbook.
AI content optimization: the system is able to discern content elements, in order to group them into similar themes and attribute value to usual associations (following the idea that neurons that fire together, wire together) in a way that they become evident in public and suggested meshes, as well as in the information landscape, no matter how they were recorded.
A mesh is a circular tree diagram, displayed in hyperbolic space. User meshes are graphs represented, compared and combined in these structures. System-generated meshes are  created automatically by the system, usually based on a document TOC.
User blockchain database: all public content is registered in a blockchain database, and can be traced to its owner. Bots are not allowed and should be blocked without previous notice. Unsuitable content can result in hardware lock.

The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is an unique numeric commercial book identifier, purchased from the International ISBN Agency and its affiliates. The number is 10 digits long if assigned before 2007, and 13 digits long after that. The assigning method is nation-specific and varies between countries, often depending on how large the publishing industry is.

The Library of Congress Classification is a system of library classification used for shelving books in a library. It has been criticized for lacking a sound theoretical basis; many of the classification decisions were driven by the practical needs of that library rather than epistemological considerations. Although it divides subjects into broad categories, it is essentially enumerative in nature. That is, it provides a guide to the books actually in one library's collections, not a classification of the world.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_tree	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_tree?utm_source=pocket_mylist
A hyperbolic tree is an information visualization and graph drawing method inspired by hyperbolic geometry. Nodes in focus are placed in the center and given more room, while out-of-focus nodes are compressed near  boundaries. Focusing on a different node brings it and its children to the center of the disk, while uninteresting portions of the tree are compressed. Hyperbolic trees employ hyperbolic space, which intrinsically has "more room" than Euclidean space. The Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry displays the entire hyperbolic plane within a unit disk, making the entire tree visible at once. The unit disk gives a fish-eye lens view of the plane, giving more emphasis to nodes which are in focus and displaying nodes further out of focus closer to the boundary of the disk. Hyperbolic trees were patented in the U.S. by Xerox in 1996, since expired.

The Dewey Decimal Classification, or Dewey Decimal System, is a proprietary library classification system. OCLC, a non-profit cooperative that serves libraries, currently maintains the system and licenses online access to WebDewey, a continuously updated version for catalogers. It introduced the concepts of relative location and index, which allow new books to be added to a library in their appropriate location based on subject.  The classification's notation makes use of three-digit numbers for main classes, with fractional decimals allowing expansion for further detail. Numbers can be expanded to cover special aspects of general subjects. A library assigns a classification number that unambiguously locates a particular volume in a position relative to other books in the library, on the basis of its subject. It is used in 200,000 libraries in at least 135 countries.
