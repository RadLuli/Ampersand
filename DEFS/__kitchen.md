## 3 eBook

**Books** - text documents in computer-readable formats. Scanned formats (.djvu, photocopy PDFs etc) can be digitized but will not generate automatic meshes. These formats are, gladly, increasingly uncommon.

**Import** - the important thing in this process is to retrieve the index/TOC of the text and transform it into mesh. With the support of Artificial Intelligence algorithms, it can be integrated into an informational landscape and even identify essential or redundant points of the converted TOC.

**Index/TOC** - it is necessary to analyze the EPUB3 format to understand how the index/Table of contents is marked, as it is from this content that the first map will be generated.

Is it possible, through the ISBN or catalog card, to discover the macro area in which a given book is located to locate it in an informative landscape?[^1]

[^1] Check the structuring of catalog cards, the Dewey index and the formation of the ISBN, as well as the bar code catalog of the Library of Congress of the United States. Wikipedia's set of categories is also an option.


## 4 Information Landscape

**information landscape** [^1] - the idea is to present a content block as an address in an urban landscape, which can be visited in different degrees of interaction and depth, depending on the vehicle used.

Understanding (even exposure to) any content is never linear or even at the same level of depth for everyone. A physicist can read a math book quite differently than a philosopher, for example. Therefore, instead of exposing a universe of knowledge in the same way to everyone, the idea is to distribute it in a three-dimensional "landscape", which can be visited in different ways, each with a different level of exposure, depth and interaction possible or demanded:

| Vehicle | Information level | Location | Freedom | Interactivity |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Tour bus** | Shallow | Guided | None | Very little |
| **Public transport (surface)** | Shallow | Fixed | None | little |
| **Subway** | Focused | Fixed | None | Little |
| **Car/Taxi** | Average | Free | Little | Little |
| **Bicycle** | Deep | Free | Medium | Medium |
| **Walking** | Deep | Free | Hight | High |
| **Visit to address** | Very deep | Free | Extreme | Very high |

Thus, those who do not know a subject (Jazz, for example) can take a tour bus with a very guided tour and specific stopping points so that they can get a good overview of the subject. On the other hand, an enthusiast or specialist (a musician, in the previous example) would not waste time with generalities and could go straight to the necessary address, extracting information incomprehensible (or invaluable) for a layman.

A classification system, such as that of the US Library of Congress, can serve as a frame of reference.

**TODO:** Tags, questionnaires, taxonomies, folksonomies can help determine (or refine) a location or address in an informational landscape. See categories (and API[^2]) from Amazon, why not?

[^1] The first (and only) time I saw the term used was an article by Fabrice Florin in a book on interactive multimedia learning published by Apple in 1990. There is no shadow of this concept online and, by the way, the concept itself author forgot about him. So I'm going to take ownership of it, even because it was something that has never left my mind since my master's degree. I'll see if he says what I imagine or if it's “just” my interpretation.

## 5 Mesh
*join with 6 Notes?*

**Mind Maps[^1]** - Radial diagrams have been around for a long time. Their major advantages towards linear texts are:
- **Adimensionality** - a segment can be tiny or huge, and vary immensely
- **Non-linearity** - like ideas that form, a topic can start from any point
- **Thematic diversity** - any topic can build on any other. The relevance is up to the author
- **Formal diversity** - colors, shapes, sounds, photos, videos, links, texts and dictations are some possible formats to use

[^1]: the "Mind Map" term was popularized by Tony Buzan, and it is only a part of what a *mesh* really is. **TODO:** understand a little more about mind maps, their importance and effects as forms of learning and communication. 

**Mesh** - radial diagram, similar to a mind map, but with more features, multidimensional, integrated and with an artificial intelligence system to interpret notes and similar content, as well as to prioritize more popular connections between similar meshes that are public.

The mesh design should be more geometric, more angular than a mind map. The idea is to use a hyperbolic diagram.

**Registered mesh** - In addition to the automatic mesh, generated from the index/TOC, any user contribution, even if minimal (as long as it is public), can be aggregated to - or accessed from - other meshes.

TODO: I still don't know if it's worth maintaining the independence of each map or if it's not better to assume right away that the reader would have access to all the recorded interpretations of the book since the first visit. To see.

## 6 Notes
*join with 5 Mesh?*

**Marginalia** - reader annotations in book margins[^1] are (for me, at least) the pinnacle point of a book relationship with its audience, intense up to the point where  readers cannot contain themselves and **need** to mark right there, in the book body, their opinion and/or additional comments. It is a very rich moment that needs to be shared, for even the note-takers tend to be surprised by their impact when rereading their notes. Sadly, these notes are usually wasted.

[^1]: See JACKSON, H. J. **Marginalia: Readers Writing in Books**. Yale University Press, 2001. 

*From Wikipedia* - "Catherine C. Marshall, doing research on the future of [user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface "User interface") design, has studied the phenomenon of user annotation of texts. She discovered that in several university departments, students would scour the piles of textbooks at used book dealers for consistently annotated copies. The students had a good appreciation for their predecessors' distillation of knowledge. In recent years, the marginalia left behind by university students as they engage with library textbooks has also been a topic of interest to sociologists looking to understand the experience of being a university student. See [*Marginalia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia), notes [8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia#cite_note-8), [9](https://en.swikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia#cite_note-9), [10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia#cite_note-10), [11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia#cite_note-11) and [12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia#cite_note-12)".






**Contributions** here the name *Ampersand* shows its meaning. In the [OAF](oaf.md) format, the book author acts as a *spark*, a *conversation starter*, who doesn't even need to be central. A reader's work can be even bigger or more comprehensive than the original book its [mesh](mesh.md) is based upon, just like what happens in modern genres like *fanfic* or in collaborative books/blogs like “The Martian”, in which the commenting community has a strong influence over the work. Unlike this kind of blog that become books (and films, like *Julie&Julia*) authors don't keep all the glory for themselves. Readers/collaborators can cooperate with any amount of public meshes, texts and/or media.

**Annotations** can be made on:
- Typed text
- Dictated text
- Manuscript
- Audio recordings
- Photos
- Video recordings
- Drawings
- Links

Notes should be in **<span style="color:#18ffff">color</span>** to facilitate memorizing content.

All **public annotations**, whether generated automatically or by user contributions, as well as the record of your edits or changes are recorded in a blockchain. The user can access or modify previous public editions, but even if they are deleted, they will remain stored to avoid the distribution of contents contrary to the platform's code of ethics.

Private annotations are, by definition, completely free and editable and can be completely deleted. A private annotation can only be made public by its author from his device(s). Screenshots can be immediately deleted without any prior notice


## 8 Social

**Social Applications** - Books can be the starting point of very specific **social networks** that work like Internet forums: only someone who has something really relevant to add tends to be given any space. 

Nowadays, that less than a dozen very generic "social networks" centralize most of the social activity, an attitude of "fame for its own sake", typical of celebrity culture, which does not tend to generate anything constructive, is commonplace. 

If, instead of a few large social networks, there are millions of very specific communities, each for every book theme, generic identities tend to lose value. It doesn't make sense that someone who has nothing to contribute to the universe of a theme like “Harry Potter”, for example, has to seek space in a network whose center is in one of these books. (see *locus/place of speech*)




**Public notes** - Unlike the anarchy of current “social networks”, here the idea of social behavior[^1] is taken seriously. Factual accuracy is not required—they are opinions, after all—but good behavior is by no means optional. Anything that has been recorded in public annotations will be marked in a blockchain and its author identified. Depending on the type of behavior, its author can be given either the “right to be forgotten” or a temporary or permanent ban from the network, including hardware lock.

[^1] (see Erich Fromm)

**Reference to a Mesh/Book**  - The open nature of annotations naturally allows books and meshes to be referenced in other books and meshes. How to combine all this information avoiding excess, redundancy or recursion? The same goes for both direct references to books and meshes, as well as indirect references to them. One idea might be to use a point structure such as “pagerank” to assign relevance in the information landscape. Something similar to the academic impact factor.

## 10 Users + Authors

**Users** can, of course, be passive readers, just like what happens in all other e-reading platforms, but this is not what is expected in a true *Ampersand* experience. Reader users are, of course, not expected to be *co-authors*, for this is too big a demand for any reader.

The idea is for users to be **collaborators**, who, as the term says are, *co-laborers*, meaning people who, like the author, are also dedicated to the topic, albeit without as much authority, depth, competence or even dedication. 

This is why their name stays at the right side of the Ampersand, like in "*The Origin of Species & Luli*"

**Author** - tend to be the most sacrificed in interactive content, since their work can never be considered "closed", since they are forced to keep the content constantly updated - or worse, to promptly respond to doubts or requests from readers - which tends to lead them to abandon interactive resources or replace a single author by a team responsible for editorial content. Neither practice is healthy: the first discourages interaction, and the second makes the content lose authenticity.

In the OAF format, the author does what he has always done and manages to reach a conclusion of his work, which, once published, starts to receive contributions from users. It will be up to them, if they deem it to be appropriate, any update of data or context, as well as its expansion. The author may, at any time, participate in the construction of public maps - identified, like all other users - but their contributions may have a greater weight or a more central location in the mesh. Like in LinkedIn comments, where the post's author is always marked as such.

## 11 Code of conduct
**TODO**: code of ethics

**Piracy**

dasds
The system does not care about the origin or piracy of books. There is no store.
