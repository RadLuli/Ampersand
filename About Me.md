## About me

My name is Luli Radfahrer. I am a tenured associate professor at [ECA](https://www.eca.usp.br/)/[USP](https://www5.usp.br/), Brazil. For the last 30 years, I've been researching, mentoring and teaching digital design and the impact of digital technologies on society. That led me to write some books (like [this](http://www.estantevirtual.com.br/livros/luli-radfahrer/design-web-design/3544325215) on digital design and [this](http://www.estantevirtual.com.br/livros/luli-radfahrer/enciclopedia-da-nuvem/927040668?gclid=CjwKCAjw7--KBhAMEiwAxfpkWK8_ma4BMbfwB04tMV5WU6_Ul8PmMVroCWUTpQ5BAZetJdT0qD33aRoC0RUQAvD_BwE) on cloud technologies, both out of print). It also led me to write a [column](http://www.bit.ly/luli-folha) for the biggest brazilian newspaper, **Folha de S. Paulo**, to have a [weekly radio column](link) at RÃ¡dio USP, to some [media interviews](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQTUQG-vBiU), [public lectures](http://www.ted.com/talks/luli_radfahrer_os_empregos_acabaram_e_isso_e_uma_excelente_noticia?language=pt-br) and talks. But all too ephemeral, and with little impact.

In October 2021, after the global pandemic, I began a 10-year journey to reinvent what we know as the e-book, that I intend to post here. It will be registered in English, for this is supposed to be an open source, worldwide project.

All help is welcome. Thanks in advance.

Best regards, L.
