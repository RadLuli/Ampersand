## About me

![Luli Radfahrer](ETC/luli.jpg)

My name is **Luli Radfahrer**. I am a tenured associate professor at [ECA](https://www.eca.usp.br/)/[USP](https://www5.usp.br/), Brazil. For the last 30 years, I've been researching, mentoring and teaching digital design and the impact of digital technologies on society. That led me to write books (like [this](https://bit.ly/301pvtz) on design and [this](https://bit.ly/3iCBrsa) on cloud technologies, both out of print). It also led me to write a [newspaper column](http://www.bit.ly/luli-folha) for **Folha de S. Paulo**, to have a [weekly radio column](http://bit.ly/Luli-RadioUSP) at RÃ¡dio USP,  some [media interviews](https://bit.ly/3DhtW1O), [public lectures](http://bit.ly/Luli-TED) and talks. 

I love to teach, but I strongly believe that the whole education process is outdated. Classes can be better, technology can be less selfish, and social media can be more social. It is too much that needs changing, and one has to choose their battles. So in October 2021 I started a 10-year journey to reinvent what we know as the e-book (which, like [Cory Doctorow](*) said, are *"Neither E, Nor Books"*. My intention is to build a worldwide, open source project. All help is welcome.
